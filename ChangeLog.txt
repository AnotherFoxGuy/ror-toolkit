- Terrain Editor:
	+ Start Character Position, camera Start Position: just move red meshes 
	    to the desired position
	
	+ Object Inspector that allow user to type coords and rotation angles. 
	  You can also add a comment to every object (useful to describe the first
	    and last road objects, for example: "begin road to castle city")
	  Comments may be multilinea but if you use "/", it will be deleted.
	  ENTER key must be the last key to press, 
	    because it is when text and comments are saved.
	
	+ Contigous Block Mode: The first block is added like you did it before, 
	    that is: click on terrain ground, then use right button click 
		on Object Tree
	  to add the object to the terrain and now, click the object just added, 
	    while it is highlighted press SPACE BAR key, you would see another piece 
	  automatically added updating X, Y, Z coords and copying RotX, RotY, RotZ.
	  
	  Keep in mind that SPACE BAR will add the selected item 
	    in Object Tree next to the selected one on 3D-Window.
	  3D-Window must be focused (just right click in the window) before 
	    pressing SPACE.
	
	+ alphabetically Ordered Object Tree for each category (names are changed 
	  to lowercase to maintain a consistent ordered items)
	
	+ Support Multiple SpawnZones on Terrain.
	+ keys UIO rotate to create ascend/descend ramp. keys JKL  rotate to create
	  corners keys M<comma><dot> rotate on X axis (banked curves??)
	+ Skins support for Object Tree, Object Inspector, 
	  Object Preview and Map Options
	+ Control Key while selecting a piece and dragging = freedom movement 
	  (the piece should be unselected, then keep CTRL pressed while selecting)
	+ Q key attach camera to selected object so, you can rotate camera 
	  with AWSDFV keys around the selected object.
	+ avoid to select deleted/invisible objects.
	+ Improved singleton pattern
	+ If no Camera/Character/Truck Start Position are supplied on
	  the .terrn file or its coordenates are (0,0,0) 
		they are setup on the middle of the map 
		  at terrain Height or water Level (max value)
