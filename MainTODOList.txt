Main TODO List
===============

Here it is what Lepes was thinking about Toolkit, before he implement nothing :-D

truck editor:
renumbering tool, delete groups of nodes/beams...etc


RoR Terrain
- DEGA: save button enable only if saved previously.
- DEGA: non understood lines (as trees) shouldn't been deleted from terrain
- Lenni request: implement begin_tree 
- fixed: rotating planes / bridges when saving
- don't allow camera to get out of the terrain : because ogre.Ray doesn't work and hang !! solutions:
    - just disable click in objects 
    - "C" key will control both settings (go underground and out of terrain bounds)
- Before minimizing main window, hide main_frame_tools_xxxxx (it is shown on task bar ugly and it hangs main app.
- fix shapedWindow when dragging on main StaticText (info window is not fixed)
- fixed: shapedwindow main label Font Size
- interesting: saving an object on position (0,0,0) RoR crash with Report bug window ;-)
- configurable keymap
- fixed: dynamic scale for RoRCharacter / RoRcamera / Truck Start Position, so you could drag & drop easily with larger zoom. 


- imposible to move from float to decimal due ogre wrapper.
